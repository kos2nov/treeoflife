    Therapeutic massage is a medically proven method for supporting your health and wellness. You’ll enjoy benefits of…
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Increases circulation, which allows the body to pump more oxygen and nutrients into tissues and vital
            organs.
        </li>
        <li>Stimulates the lymph system, the body's natural defense, against toxic invaders. For example, in breast
            cancer patients, massage has been shown to increase the cells that fight cancer.
        </li>
        <li>Releases endorphins, the body's natural painkiller. For this reason, massage is incorporated in treatment
            for chronic illnesses, injury and recovery from surgery to control and relieve pain.
        </li>
        <li>Improves range of motion and decreases discomfort associated with lower back pain.</li>
        <li>Relaxes and softens injured and overused muscles.</li>
        <li>Reduces muscle spasms and cramping.</li>
        <li>Increases joint flexibility.</li>

        Of the five senses, touch is the one that is most developed at birth. There is a research proving that infant
        massage has enormous benefits for helping babies grow and for their overall health. Study after study has shown

        relieve muscle tension.
        <br/>
        Many problems that cause suffering in adults - such as an untreated birth injury, which can lead to structural
        problems, emotional trauma, and myofascial
        trigger point from musculoskeletal injuries - can be resolved far more easily when the problem first arises in
        early life. In this sense, massaging children is truly preventive medicine.

    <h3 class="highlight">Thai Massage</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Traditional Thai Massage</b> is performed on a large floor mat and the recipient remains fully clothed.
        Each session begins by working the muscles of your feet, and then continues working with compression techniques
        and manipulation of acupressure points.
        Muscles of the legs and hips are addressed before the back and shoulders.</li>
        ﻿The stretches, lengthen and loosen muscles and are designed to balance and realign the body over a period of
        time.
        When combined, these techniques flow in a comforting rhythm that lets your body fall into a deep state of
        relaxation.
        Thai massage is a unique, ancient, and time-tested form of bodywork.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Thai Herbal Massage</b><br/>
        Herbal healing has deep roots in Thai culture. Herbal heat compress is the best-known traditional therapy.
        This dates back to ancient times when it was the secret healing technique of Buddhist monks, local herbal
        healers and midwives.
        <br/>
        The treatment begins with a deep-pressure Thai massage,
        then a unique poultice of steamed Thai herbal ingredients applied to help sooth and relax muscle tension and
        other aches and pains.
        <br/>
        Aromatic camphor in the compress eases respiration. Traditional Thai medicine uses herbal heat compression for
        the treatment of sprains,
        muscle pain, bruises and swelling. Anti-inflammatory properties of the Thai herbs soothe and calm the muscle
        into a more relaxed state.
    </p>

    <p>
        ﻿<b>Nerve Touch</b><br/>
        Nerve Touch also known as "Jap Sen" massage, meaning to grasp the sen. This is a deeper approach with focus on
        therapy for joints,
        nerves and relieving painful conditions. It applies stronger pressure using knees, elbows, feet, heels and
        thumbs.
        Master Lek Chaiya has developed this unique and very therapeutic style of Thai massage.
        There is a rolling over or "gentle twanging" of the muscles and nerves for deep release of tension and
        therapeutic benefit
        for conditions such as sciatica, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, numbness, paralysis, frozen shoulder and
        many other conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Thai Foot Massage</b> is an ancient Chinese massage and has been in use for more than 3,000 years.
        The theory is that the sensory nerves of the body’s inner organs are spread throughout the body and are
        connected to the most
        superficial layer of the body, such as the skin. All sensory nerves are rooted primarily at the bottom of the
        foot.
        Massaging and pressing specific points on the soles of the feet associated with particular organs produces a
        therapeutic effect
        in corresponding parts of the body, helps stimulate activities of the inner organs and improves blood and lymph
        circulation.<br/>
        Thai Foot Reflexology combined with Traditional Thai massage is good for ensuring good health and well being,
        relieves pain,
        muscle tension & stiffness.

<section class="massage-types" id="lymphatic">
    <h3 class="highlight">Lymphatic Drainage</h3>

    <p>
        <em>What is the lymph system?</em> It is the water of interstitial fluid that originates in the connective
        tissue spaces of the body and the lymphatic system acts as a purification center for the whole body. As this
        fluid enters the first lymph capillaries, it is called lymph. The lymph captures and regains protein rich
        liquids. The lymph also contains lymphocytes, macrophages and other immune cells which break down pathogens,
        dead cells, cancer cells, mutant cells and foreign bodies that are found in the interstitial fluid. The lymph
        nodes destroy those harmful particles so they can eventually be flushed out of the body.
        <br/>
        <em>Why is it beneficial to work with the lymph system?</em> When the lymph system is sluggish or damaged, fluid
        builds up and the tissues may look “puffy”. The immune system may be compromised by sluggish lymph since many of
        the immune cells are contained in the lymph tissue.
        <br/>
        Lymphatic drainage is very gentle work and extremely relaxing to the parasympathetic nervous system.
        At the cellular level, lymph drainage stimulates the immune system for detoxification and elimination of harmful
        substances.
        And at the same time, beneficial proteins and lipids are recovered.
        <br/>
        Lymph drainage can move stagnant fluids to improve the tonicity of the skin and muscles.
        It hydrates the skin and regenerates skin tone, reduces wrinkles and bags under the eyes.
        Headaches, migraines and sinus congestion can be alleviated. Sprains, muscle spasm and other trauma may be
        soothed by
        applying lymphatic drainage techniques. Often,range of motion will improve considerably after a lymphatic
        session.
    </p>
</section>
<section class="massage-types" id="abdomas">
    <h3 class="highlight">Abdominal Massage</h3>

    <p>
        <b>Chi Nei Tsang</b> is a Chinese term for an internal organ Chi massage.<br/>
        It integrates the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of our being. It was used by monks in
        monasteries to help detoxify, strengthen and refine their bodies in order to maintain the high energy required
        to perform the highest levels of spiritual practices.
        <br/>
        Chi Nei Tsang literally means “working the energy of the internal organs”.The work is done mainly on the abdomen
        with deep, soft and gentle touches, to train internal organs to work more efficiently.
        <br/>
        CNT manipulations help relieve the body of excess stagnation, improving elimination and stimulating the
        lymphatic and the circulatory systems. It releases deep-seated tensions and restores vitality. CNT has been
        helpful with chronic pains such as back, neck and shoulder pains and problems related to misalignment of the
        feet, legs and pelvis.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Visceral Manipulation</b> is a manual therapy technique consisting of gentle, specifically placed manual
        forces that encourage normal mobility, tone and inherent tissue motion of the viscera, their connective tissue,
        and other areas of the body where physiologic motion has been impaired. It is characterized by high precision
        and minimal force. Visceral Manipulation is based on the principle that for an organ to be healthy and have
        optimal function it must have motion. The visceral system itself relies on the interconnected synchronicity of
        the motions of the organs and the support structures of the body. A restriction, fixation or adhesion to another
        structure, no matter how small, implies functional impairment of the organ.
        <br/>
        Tissues lose their normal motion when they become inflamed. The natural healing process involves local
        disruption of normal tissue fibers and their replacement with adhesions or scar tissue. Many factors can cause
        inflammation including infections, direct trauma (surgery, falls, accidents, abuse, etc.), repetitious movement,
        diet, environmental toxins, and emotional stress. Diagnoses indicating possible disruption of the visceral
        system include spinal pain, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, gastrointestinal (GI) pain and dysfunction, and
        infertility to name a few.
        <br/>
        Unfortunately, once adhesions form, they typically remain in the body for a lifetime if left untreated.
        Adhesions may occur in pain-sensitive structures, or they may glue down structures without causing discomfort.
        <br/>
        The treatment is designed to decrease adhesions and improve organ function. I use my hands to locate abnormal
        tensions in and around the organs, muscles, connective tissues and support structures of your body. I apply
        gentle and very specific pressure where indicated to assist your body in releasing the mobility-restricting
        adhesions thus utilizing your body’s ability to self-correct. I always work within your tolerance and comfort
        level.
    </p>

<section class="massage-types" id="theramas">
    <h3 class="highlight">Therapeutic Massage</h3>

    <p>
        Therapeutic massage does more than just relax and eliminate stress from the body. It is also an alternative used
        to relieve pain. People are often surprised to see how effective massage therapy can be.
    </p>

    <p>
        Chronic pain in the muscle is typically an indication of muscle tightness. Trauma, injury, muscle repetition,
        and even stress can develop into a chronic condition if left untreated. When muscle tighten,
        the fibers within the muscle decreases in length resulting in a shortened muscle. This shortened muscle, along
        with a connective tissue called fascia, can begin to adhere to surrounding structures in the body,
        decreasing range of motion in the joints and placing pressure on nerves. Tight muscles can also lead to reduced
        circulation, which allows waste to accumulate. Waste irritates the nerves, therefore causing pain.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therapeutic massage relieve the pain by increasing circulation, softening and lengthening tight muscle and
        fascia, and breaking down any scar tissue or adhesions that have formed between tissue layers.
    </p>

    <p><em>How can muscle pain be prevented?</em></p>

    <p>Prevention is the key to keeping our bodies in healthy condition. Our bodies need regular tune-ups, just like our
        cars, to keep them performing efficiently and without problems. Getting a massage regularly enables the body
        to release unwanted stress from the muscle and helps you feel your best.
